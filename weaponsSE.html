        <p align="justify">The secondary ability of the Riotgun is gas grenades. These detonate on impact and release an initial burst of energy followed by a green gas for a short duration of about 7 seconds. Both of which drain lots of stamina. </p></td>

        <p align="justify">However the drawback to this weapon is their accuracy fails over a distance more than the UMC Riotgun, and they do not have the gas grenade capability either.   Only Chan Lee uses this weapon. </p></td>

          The primary fire and   secondary fire modes of this weapon are identical, except the secondary mode   fires the weapon at an increased speed, which is somewhat of a &quot;panic mode&quot;, for   times when enemies are very close</p>

It fires weaker blasts by default but holding your trigger can charge it up to a stronger blast.
