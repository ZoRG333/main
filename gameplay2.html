        <p align="center" class="style7">Fast. Furious. Filthy. </p>
        <p align="justify">Gore - The Ultimate Soldier is an online multi-player game with a goal of providing classic hard core FPS action, blended with pure filth, humor and unique characters to give the player an experience that is fun and unique, but also without the stress and seriousness of many other styles of FPS games.</p>
        <p align="justify"> It's about ruining your opponents in mid air, leaving their stain on a 5th story window, followed by them spawning a second later to get revenge without ever questioning how a 500 lbs. man could gain 30 feet of air by jumping on a cloth window awning and hitting you in the face with 4 barreled shotgun while drinking a beer and smoking a cigar at the same time.</p>
        <p align="justify">It's about having classic FPS fun with smooth net code and smooth performance without shelling out thousands of dollars in PC hardware just to try to keep your game running at a smooth enough frame rate during heavy firefights so that you don't lose because your wallet wasn't big enough to win a clan match.  </p>
        <p align="justify">It's game whose main features which are key to having fun being with easy controls which can be set up quickly and are easy to learn, allowing you to log in to a server and start rocking as soon as possible. </p>
        <p align="justify">We have  implemented  many new things which we feel will have a positive impact on classic game modes plus other new and popular gaming styles. The Gore Production Team  which  is based on hard core gamers, not accountants, has striven to create a  balance  of realism, interactivity, technology and most importantly <span class="style2"><em>fun</em> and <em>frame rate</em></span>, which are among the most important aspects in any PC video game.</p>

      <p align="center">
<img src="news_spacer.gif" width="612" height="8"/></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style8">System Requirements: </p>
      <p align="justify">The minimum system requirements are low and allow people with medium range computers to run the game rock solid with high frames per second at reasonable settings so all members of your team and clan can always be certain to not die because of heavy video lag in large fire fights. </p>
      <p align="justify">These low system requirements also enable players with higher end systems to take advantage of their advanced image quality settings for their video card and run the game with settings such as 8x Anti-Aliasing and 16x Anisotropic texture filtering for superb image quality while still maintaining great frame rates during heavy fighting. </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The goal with this is to allow players of a wide variety of systems to play with similar screen settings and try to eliminate a poor aspect of many FPS games where the player with the best system specs will <img src="jane.jpg" width="362" height="160" align="right"/>always have a huge upper hand. </font></p>
      <p align="justify">The bottom line is it isn't fun to lose for stupid reasons such as your computer lagging because you want to run your game in the same settings as the other guys, but don't have $500 to spend on a new video card.</p>

      <p align="justify"><span class="style2">The only thing you need to really know going in is to find people not on your team, kill them in as horrible and cool ways as you can manage, and to hit F1 if you need any help about the particular mode you are playing in.</span> Also, grab plenty of item pickups along the way to help you out.</p>

    <td width="612" height="768" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="style8">Fighting:</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">In Gore the best weapon or character to play can often times depend on the environment you are in, and the situation as well. The larger characters are able to take more damage before they fall, but this comes at a cost of less speed. It will be up to you to choose if speed or durability will matter the most to you. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">Depending on your level of skill and style of play, your best character for a given moment will differ from that of other players. The following information for fighting are only general tips, it will be up to you to find what works best for you.  For more information visit the <a href="characters.html">characters</a> page. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style2">Players can wear body armor to protect their body. Unlike many other games the armor is locations specific, so it only protects the body parts which it covers. If a player only has head armor, shoot their chest for full damage. If they only have chest armor, their head is still vulnerable. If you shoot their armor enough, you will see it shatter to pieces to expose their vulnerable body. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify" class="style5">A good strategy in fights is to try to keep your distance from opponents until you break most of their armor off, and then move in for the kill. If you have a Rocket Launcher it is often times the smart decision to keep your distance, switch to a bullet weapon and use a hail of bullets to break off the armor before attempting to use rockets. While rockets will break off armor eventually, the piercing strength of a bullet can do this much faster with good aim. </p>
    </blockquote>    
    <p align="justify" class="style2">Selection of the right weapon will be up to you and depend on your personal preference and play style. Generally for long distances bullet weapons will be the best, with the Sniper Rifles and Minigun being the top bullet weapons for a long distance. However those with good aim can just as easily dominate with automatic weapons. For more information visit the <a href="weaponsSE.html">weapons</a> page. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify" class="style6">If you are caught in a situation where you are in close quarters with an enemy who has a Rocket Launcher, and the situation seems dire, charging the enemy so you are constantly up against their body is a good way to force them to hurt themselves if they choose to continue using a Rocket Launcher. This plus shooting them at close range with an automatic weapon can sometimes result in you winning the fight, or the enemy destroying themselves. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">One unique feature in Gore is your players having physical stamina which can be gained and lost. This is your energy which allows you to run and jump. All the characters in Gore are in top physical form and do not lose any stamina while running, with the exception of Light Class characters if they  wield a heavy weapon such as a Rocket Lancher or Minigun and begin running while holding it. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">Stamina is important because the more you have, the faster you will run and jump. Jumping non-stop in fights (bunny hopping) will make your character fatigued and cause their jumps to be not as high and their movement will slow down. Being injured with weapons can also cause you to lose stamina. So if you are up against a lighter class which can move much faster than you, scoring some successful shots will slow them down some and make them easier to follow. </p>

    <td width="612" height="567" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="style8">Navigating Levels:</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">In Gore there are various situations that you must watch for when fighting opponents. Here are a few examples of the situations players will attempt to master in Gore:</p>
      <p align="justify"><span class="style3">Teleporters </span><span class="style2">- </span>Both handy and dangerous, teleporters can be used for fast navigation of the level. However they can be risky to approach, as you never know when somebody will pop out of one. If you are standing too close to one when somebody comes out, their body materialized inside yours, causing your body to tear apart.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Jump Pads</strong> - Jump Pads come in many forms. They can be a cloth awning in a city, a high out put air vent on the top of a building, or a mechanical platform. Standing on or in front of these can cause you be launched into the air. Skilled enemies will often use these to rain fire down upon opponents as they glide through the air. </p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>Energy Lifts</strong> - These are useful for vertical navigation of a level. They have the ability when entering them to either lift you up in the air to gain access to higher points, or safely lower you down a long distance which would otherwise be a deadly fall. The danger in using them is you can sometimes become an easy target while you are using one. </p>
    <p align="center"><span class="style6"><img src="metal.jpg" width="612" height="135"/></span></p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="612" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="style8">Destroyable Item Pickups:</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">One unique thing about Gore is that item pickups can be destroyed if they are shot. The more powerful the item the stronger the explosion can be. This is useful in situations where a rocket launcher or some other weapon has been dropped and you see an enemy running to take it. You can blow it up immediately to make sure they don't get it, or you can let them get very close to it before firing, and cause them damage as well.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">One object which cannot be destroyed is the <em>MAD Damage</em> pickup. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">For information about Item Pickups and what they do, go to the <a href="pickups.html">item pickups</a> page. </p>
