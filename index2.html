      <p align="justify"><a href="downloadsarchive.html">Click here to Download Gore Special Edition or Gore Ultimate Soldier.</a></p>
      <p align="justify">To those who are new to Gore, it is <em>completely free</em>. Gore was developed by 4D Rulers and Published by Dreamcatcher Interactive in 2002 and was later released as a Free game this time titled Gore Special Edition. </p>
      <p align="justify">This is a fan restoration of the Gore Special Edition page. The versions provided here include Openspy patch and working Server Browsers</p>
      <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.gorespy.com" target="_blank">
        You can also click here to view the servers on your browser.</a></p>
      <p align="justify">To download the Gore installer, please go <a href="downloadsarchive.html">here</a>. </p>
      <p align="justify">Note: Gore Special Edition and Gore Ultimate Soldier are not compatible with each other. The most active version is Gore Special Edition, so if you're new or returning player download Gore Special Edition.</p>
      <p align="justify">Note 2: If you get any CD Key errors in Gore Special Edition (either CD Key in use or other CD Key related errors) all you have to do is click on the Main Menu System Options, then click Enter a new Key. Enter any random key you want and it will work!</p>
      <p align="justify">Note 3: Windows might give you a warning when you try to run the Gore Special Edition or Gore US installers. Press More Info, then Run Anyway as it is a false alarm.</p>

We're going to release Gore for free pretty soon, with ads in it to earn us revenue, and while we're rebuilding it for this new release, you can send me your screen name or forum name, whatever you want for a small fee, and I'll put your name in the game somewhere, like we did for Patriots.</p>

All avatars must be original uncopyrighted pictures that are yours, and be approved by us. </p>
<p align="justify">To order your name tag, send me the money via paypal to: <a href="mailto:ordering@4drulers.com">ordering@4drulers.com</a> and give us your screen name that you would like us to use, and send a picture of your avatar if you want the 49.99 package.</p>
