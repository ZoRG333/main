                        overpopulation and consumption caused irreversible resource 
                        shortages over most of the planet. All supplies of fossil fuels 
                        were completely decimated by 2031. The agro-mosaic virus outbreak 
                        of 2042 triggered the global food riots of 2043 by causing the 
                        extinction of all agricultural plant species. Five billion humans, 
                        almost half of the earths population, died of starvation <br>

                          into ruin in a perpetual night of low fuel and no power, street 
                          gangs grew into terror patrols, controlling neighborhoods 
                          and sometimes entire cities. These terror patrols grew larger 
                          and larger, falling under the control of ever more powerful 
                          dictators. </span> </p>
                        <p class="textBold"><span class="copy2"> All government officials 
                          became targets for assassination, the global system of government 
                          was getting weaker by the day. As the governments began to 
                          fall and chaos began to be a way of life, all governments 
                          united and focused on the continuing search for a new energy 
                          source. Finally, in 2079, government scientists discovered 
                          a new energy source, created from anti matter chemical reactions 
                          between the grinding forces of the planets tectonic plates, 
                          a new energy source was mined, called ORE. ORE, though not 
                          energy producing itself, was able to catalyze nearly any chemical 
                          reaction and also amplify any electrical power fed into it. 
                          Because of the density of the ORE found, when energy passed 
                          through the ORE atoms were sped up to a speed never seen before, 
                          increasing energy passed through the ORE as well as creating 
                          distortion in time and the known field.<br>

                        <p class="textBold"><span class="copy2">After the ORE became 
                          common knowledge, the fighting factions used all means to 
                          gain access to the ORE's power. Using the ORE's power to bend 
                          time and fold space the MOB left earth in search of more ORE, 
                          in the process creating a war between worlds as well as on 
                          its own. <br>
                          Deep in the bowels of UMC research and development, secret 
                          experiments have led to the creation of the advanced massively 
                          parallel bio-computational neural network, with the ability 
                          to emulate higher-level thought processes and simulate the 
                          nonlinear processing of computations and complex algorithms. 
                          This advanced bio-computational neural network has created 
                          a perfect artificial environment, this new system avoids failures 
                          from the past and jerkiness caused by computational spasming 
                          in older non bio based artificial environments. </span></p>

                          uses of this new technology was the development of an advanced 
                          combat training emulator. This emulator is a virtual reality 
                          where the UMC weeds out the mentally weak and trains the best 
                          of the best to be even better. It is so realistic several 
                          level 5 marines who first tested it died of cardiac arrest.

                          they have never faced, and trains them with existing UMC weaponry, 
                          plus weaponry that are yet to be made in the real world. </span></p>
